            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
                and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development,
                accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of
                Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age
                group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age
                of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".The education system in
                Pakistan is generally divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary
                (years one to five), middle (years six to eight), high (years nine and ten, leading to the Secondary
                School Certificate or SSC), intermediate (years eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School
                Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees. The
                Higher Education Commission established in 2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding
                institutes.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Only about 67.5% of Pakistani children finish primary school
                education. The standard national system of education is mainly inspired from the English educational
                system. Pre-school education is designed for 3â€“5 years old and usually consists of three stages: Play
                Group, Nursery and Kindergarten (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After pre-school education, students go
                through junior school from years 1 to 5. This is followed by middle school from years 6 to 8. At middle
                school, single-sex education is usually preferred by the community, but co-education is also common in
                urban cities. The curriculum is usually subject to the institution. The eight commonly examined
                disciplines are:Most schools also offer drama studies, music and physical education but these are
                usually not examined or marked. Home economics is sometimes taught to female students, whereas topics
                related to astronomy, environmental management and psychology are frequently included in textbooks of
                general science. Sometimes archaeology and anthropology are extensively taught in textbooks of social
                studies

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Secondary education in Pakistan begins in year 9 and lasts for four
                years. After end of each of the school years, students are required to pass a national examination
                administered by a regional Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (or BISE).

                Upon completion of year 9, students are expected to take a standardised test in each of the first parts
                of their academic subjects (SSC-I). They again take these tests of the second parts of the same courses
                at the end of year 10 (SSC-II). Upon successful completion of these examinations, they are awarded a
                Secondary School Certificate (or SSC). This is locally termed a 'matriculation certificate' or 'matric'
                for short. The curriculum usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives (such as
                Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory subjects (such as Mathematics, English,
                Urdu, Islamic studies and Pakistan Studies). The total marks for Matric are 1100 divided between 9th and
                10th.[18] The marks are divided in each year follows: 75 marks for Maths, English and Urdu, 50 marks for
                Islamic Studies (or ethics for Non Muslim students) and Pakistan Studies, 60 marks for Sciences
                (Biology, Chemistry, Physics). An additional 90 marks are allotted for practicals (30 for each science).
                Students then enter an intermediate college and complete year 11 and 12.
